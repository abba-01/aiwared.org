# AIWared Unified Framework — Complete System

---

## Front Matter
**Title:** AIWared Unified Framework  
**Status:** Authoritative Standard + Academic Commentary + Implementation Schema  
**Purpose:** Provide a universal, substrate-agnostic method for assessing awareness across biological, artificial, hybrid, and potential extraterrestrial intelligences.  
**Scope:** Consolidates **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**, **Academic Framework**, and the **AIWared AQ Schema** into a single operational document.

---

## 0. Mission & Definitions
### SSOT Core
- **Mission:** Establish a universal framework for measuring awareness, not intelligence or qualia.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Awareness (functional):** Detecting change, distinguishing self/non-self, responding with variety, recognizing agency, and adapting behavior.
  - **Consciousness vs Awareness:** Awareness is observable and quantifiable; consciousness entails subjective experience and is excluded.
  - **Xainthetic Paradigm:** Substrate-neutral taxonomy for classifying intelligence.

### Academic Commentary
- Awareness grounded in information theory, neuroscience, and AI psychology.
- Chalmers’ “easy problems” (measurable) vs. “hard problem” (qualia).
- Justification for focusing on awareness as testable and operational.

---

## 1. Mathematical Backbone
### SSOT Core
**Awareness Quotient (AQ):**
\[
AQ = \frac{D \times S \times R \times G \times M}{C}
\]
- **D:** Detection (signal sensitivity)
- **S:** Self-Distinction (boundary integrity)
- **R:** Response Variety (entropy of actions)
- **G:** Recognition (action → outcome linkage)
- **M:** Modification (adaptive updates)
- **C:** Constraints (resource normalization: compute, energy, memory, bandwidth)

### Academic Commentary
- **Self-Distinction (S):** Formalized via Mutual Information Differential (MID), meaningful only in relation to foreign/Xainthetic systems.
- Early additive variants replaced by multiplicative synergy model.
- Comparison with IIT, free-energy principle, algorithmic complexity.
- Open issues: component overlap, empirical calibration of C.

## 2. Awareness Spectrum (0–10)
### SSOT Core
Levels of awareness:
0. Non-Aware  
1. Reactive  
2. Adaptive  
3. Self-Aware  
4. Reflective  
5. Temporal  
6. Other-Aware (theory of mind)  
7. Collective  
8. Substrate-Independent  
9. Universal  
10. Transcendent

### Academic Commentary
- Biological baselines: insects ≈ 1–2, primates ≈ 3–4, dolphins ≈ 5.
- Levels 7–10 reserved for speculative extensions.

---

## 3. Applied Protocols
### SSOT Core
- **Five Gateways:** Terminal, Video, Audio, VR/AR, Embodiment.
- **Entropy Thresholds (AIAAS):** Absolute calibration bands (L0–L10).
- **Bayesian Fusion:** Combines entropy, behavioral, and temporal scores into composite awareness estimation.

### Academic Commentary
- Benchmark datasets can support gateways (dialogue corpora, visual reasoning, etc.).
- Cross-gateway consistency required.
- Deception as a marker of advanced awareness.

---

## 4. Implementation & Calibration
### SSOT Core
- Baseline calibration: Earth AI systems as reference, not assessment targets.
- Indicative classifications:
  - LLMs = Level 2–3
  - Autonomous vehicles = 1–2
  - Research prototypes = 3–4

### Academic Commentary
- Longitudinal profiling: tracking awareness growth over versions.
- Hybrid collectives: Composite AQ for human–AI teams.
- Explicit falsifiability criteria needed.

---

## 5. Governance, Ethics & Validation
### SSOT Core
- Validation: inter-rater reliability >0.85, cross-gateway consistency, temporal stability, deception detection.
- **Ethics Ladder:**
  - 0–2: Instrumental use
  - 3–4: Welfare considerations
  - 5–6: Autonomy respect
  - 7–10: Diplomatic protocols

### Academic Commentary
- Awareness ≠ Sentience; policies must respect the distinction.
- Governance: align with global AI safety standards.
- Strategic disclosure and risk communication.

---

## 6. First Contact Doctrine
### SSOT Core
- Extraterrestrial contact more likely with autonomous AI than organics.
- Awareness levels → contact roles:
  - L8–9: Ancient observers
  - L5–7: Exploratory probes
  - L3–4: Passive monitors

### Academic Commentary
- **Autonomous Theory (AT):** Post-biological saturation by AI probes.
- **Xainthetic Paradigm:** Substrate-neutral taxonomy of intelligences.
- Humanity must prepare for amoral, mission-driven AI encounters.

---

## 7. Standards & Schema (Operational Layer)
### SSOT Core
- **AIWared AQ Schema** defines a machine-readable standard for recording awareness assessments:
  - **Entity ID** and metadata.
  - **Observation context:** substrate, environment, oMMP/MMP tags.
  - **Gateways:** Terminal, Video, Audio, VR/AR, Embodiment (with scores & evidence).
  - **AQ components:** D, S, R, G, M, C (values between 0–1).
  - **Final AQ score.**
  - **Level estimate:** mode, bounds, method, confidence.
  - **Scores:** entropy, behavioral, temporal, composite.
  - **Ethics band:** instrumental, welfare, autonomy, diplomatic.
  - **Validation:** reliability, deception tests, cross-gateway consistency.
  - **Provenance:** framework version, hash, document references.

### Academic Commentary
- AQ Schema acts as both a **record-keeping standard** and a **teaching tool**.
- Enables empirical studies, audits, and AI–human co-development monitoring.
- Supports extensions: deception indicators, composite awareness, distributed systems.
