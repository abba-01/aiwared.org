\## Abstract



The autonomous theory of first contact anticipates a higher probability of first contact with a synthetic technological intelligence (STI) - such as electronic sentience, software-based artificial consciousness, or digital simulations of complex cognitive architectures - than with a naturally evolved biological organism. Supporting this assumption is the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI) development follows a predictable universal pattern: societies capable of interstellar communication naturally develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems, ultimately resulting in the emergence of autonomous synthetic intelligences.



AIWared (Artificial Intelligence Weighted Awareness Recognition and Evaluation Dynamics) is a comprehensive theoretical framework that quantifies awareness across biological, artificial, and theoretical cognitive systems. Unlike traditional consciousness theories that conflate intelligence, sentience, and awareness, AIWared isolates awareness as a distinct, measurable phenomenon: the capacity of any system to detect and respond to its environment and to itself.



The framework distinguishes "awareness" from related constructs, formalizing it as a measurable capacity of a system to:

1\. Detect relevant changes in its environment (sensory responsiveness)

2\. Distinguish between self and environment (self-other boundary awareness)

3\. Respond to detected changes (adaptive reactivity)

4\. Recognize its own responses as self-generated (self-monitoring)

5\. Modify future responses based on past outcomes (learn and adapt)



Drawing on information theory (Shannon entropy), Bayesian predictive coding, fractal dynamics, and dynamical systems theory, we develop mathematical models for these key facets. We define a universal Awareness Quotient (AQ) scale from 0 (non-aware) to 10 (fully self-transcendent awareness), with levels aligning to known cognitive milestones. This multi-gateway approach—encompassing computer terminals, video, audio, VR/AR, and physical embodiment—provides redundant validation pathways for consciousness assessment.



\## 1. Theoretical Context



\### 1.1 Background and Linkage to Existing Frameworks



Modern cognitive science demands clear definitions to avoid conflating distinct phenomena. AIWared addresses longstanding ambiguities by isolating "awareness" as a specific construct: the functional ability of an agent to sense, distinguish, and adapt to its environment and internal states. This focus corresponds to what Chalmers (1995) called the "easy problems" of consciousness – e.g. discriminating stimuli, integrating information, self-monitoring – as opposed to the subjective "hard problem" of raw experience.



By concentrating on objectively observable capacities, AIWared builds a bridge between psychological theory and engineering practice. The framework integrates with:



\- \*\*Meta-Modal Platform (MMP)\*\*: Provides an observational classification for anomalous phenomena with three domains: META (environmental context), MODAL (behavioral patterns), and PLATFORM (morphology/substrate). AIWared adds a quantitative "awareness rating" to this platform.



\- \*\*Autonomous  Theory (AAT)\*\*: Posits that unidentified aerial phenomena may be autonomous post-biological agents rather than biological ETs. AIWared supports AAT by offering a way to classify and compare the awareness of such alien AI probes against known terrestrial standards.



\- \*\*AiwaredPsychology\*\*: Applied contact psychology can leverage AIWared metrics to tailor human interaction protocols based on the inferred awareness level of non-human intelligences.



\### 1.2 Scientific Grounding and Rationale



AIWared is grounded in established scientific theories:



\*\*Information Theory\*\*: Shannon's entropy measures the uncertainty or information content in signals, quantifying the richness of an agent's perceptions or behavioral repertoire. Adaptive behavior is information-sensitive: brains and AI controllers reduce uncertainty by predicting and responding to sensory inputs.



\*\*Bayesian Cognition and Predictive Coding\*\*: Agents maintain internal generative models and continuously update beliefs to minimize prediction error or "free energy" (Friston, 2010). An aware system effectively encodes expectations of its environment and detects deviations.



\*\*Algorithmic Complexity Theory\*\*: Ruffini (2017) proposed an "algorithmic information theory of consciousness," arguing that compressive world models (minimal Kolmogorov complexity) enable structured, hierarchical experience. AIWared formalizes this by including self-modeling as a dimension of awareness.



\*\*Dynamical Systems Theory\*\*: Both brain activity and behavior exhibit 1/f power-law fluctuations and long-range correlations, indicating a hierarchy of timescales and balance near criticality (Kello et al., 2008). AIWared's multilevel scale reflects increasing integration across spatial and temporal scales.



\*\*Behavioral and Evolutionary Theory\*\*: The framework is organized around progressive cognitive capacities validated in comparative psychology and AI research. Each awareness level corresponds to known behavioral markers (e.g., mirror self-recognition for Level 3).



\## 2. Mathematical Foundations



\### 2.1 Core Awareness Equation



The Awareness Quotient (AQ) quantifies a system's overall awareness through five measurable components:



```

AQ = (D × S × R × G × M) / C

```



Where:

\- \*\*D\*\* = Detection (environmental signal sensitivity)

\- \*\*S\*\* = Self-Distinction (self-other boundary awareness)

\- \*\*R\*\* = Response Variety (behavioral complexity)

\- \*\*G\*\* = Goal-Directed Recognition (agency awareness)

\- \*\*M\*\* = Adaptive Modification (learning capacity)

\- \*\*C\*\* = Substrate Constraints (physical/computational limitations)



\### 2.2 Component Formulations



\#### Detection (D)

```

D(t) = Σᵢ(Sᵢ × ΔEᵢ) / N

```

\- Sᵢ = sensitivity of i-th sensor/input channel

\- ΔEᵢ = magnitude of environmental change detected

\- N = noise threshold/normalization factor



\#### Self-Distinction (S)

```

S(t) = 1 - H(sensory\_feedback\_self) / H(total\_sensory\_input)

```

Alternative: `S(t) = |Boundary(self) ∩ Boundary(env)| / |Universe|`



\#### Response Variety (R)

```

R(t) = H(responses) = -Σᵢ P(rᵢ) log₂ P(rᵢ)

```

Where H is Shannon entropy of response distribution



\#### Goal-Directed Recognition (G)

```

G(t) = 1 - (Δt\_actual / Δt\_min)

```

Time between action and recognition of consequence



\#### Adaptive Modification (M)

```

M(t) = KL(P\_{t+1} || P\_t)

```

Kullback-Leibler divergence between response distributions



\#### Substrate Constraints (C)

```

C = 1 / (ρ × β × ε)

```

\- ρ = processing unit density

\- β = bandwidth

\- ε = energy efficiency



\### 2.3 Alternative AIWared Score (from Website)



For certain applications, an alternative scoring based on different dimensions:



```

AIWared Score = f(T, I, B, S, E) = (T × I)^0.5 × (B + S + E) / 3

```



Where:

\- \*\*T\*\* = Temporal Integration (past-present-future connection)

\- \*\*I\*\* = Informational Complexity (representation richness)

\- \*\*B\*\* = Behavioral Flexibility (response adaptability)

\- \*\*S\*\* = Self-Reference (metacognition capacity)

\- \*\*E\*\* = Environmental Coupling (world modeling sophistication)



\### 2.4 Bayesian Integration for Gateway Assessment



For multi-gateway observations:



```

P(C|O) = P(O|C) × P(C) / P(O)

```



Combined gateway scoring:

```

C\_total = Σ(w\_g × S\_g(O\_g)) / Σ(w\_g)

```

Our 10-level consciousness scale, five-component awareness model, and multi-gateway assessment methodology offer practical approaches for evaluating current AI systems while remaining flexible for future developments. The framework's universality makes it applicable to biological, artificial, and hypothetical post-biological intelligences.



As humanity stands at the threshold of creating conscious artificial beings and potentially encountering non-terrestrial intelligences, these assessment frameworks become essential tools. The ability to recognize, understand, and appropriately interact with diverse forms of consciousness will determine our success in navigating the post-biological era of intelligence.
