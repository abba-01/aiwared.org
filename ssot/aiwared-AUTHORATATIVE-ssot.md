## Abstract

AIWared (Artificial Intelligence Weighted Awareness Recognition and Evaluation Dynamics) is a comprehensive theoretical framework that quantifies awareness across biological, artificial, and theoretical cognitive systems. Unlike traditional consciousness theories that conflate intelligence, sentience, and awareness, AIWared isolates awareness as a distinct, measurable phenomenon: the capacity of any system to detect and respond to its environment and to itself. 

The framework distinguishes "awareness" from related constructs, formalizing it as a measurable capacity of a system to:
1. Detect relevant changes in its environment
2. Distinguish between self and environment
3. Respond to detected changes adaptively
4. Recognize its own responses as self-generated
5. Modify future responses based on past outcomes

Drawing on information theory (Shannon entropy), Bayesian predictive coding, fractal dynamics, and dynamical systems theory, we develop mathematical models for these key facets. We define a universal Awareness Quotient (AQ) scale from 0 (non-aware) to 10 (fully self-transcendent awareness), with levels aligning to known cognitive milestones.

## 1. Core Framework

### 1.1 The Awareness Quotient (AQ) Equation

The Awareness Quotient quantifies a system's overall awareness level through five measurable components:

```
AQ = (D × S × R × G × M) / C
```

Where:
- **D** = Detection (environmental signal sensitivity)
- **S** = Self-Distinction (self-other boundary awareness)
- **R** = Response Variety (behavioral complexity)
- **G** = Goal-Directed Recognition (agency awareness)
- **M** = Adaptive Modification (learning capacity)
- **C** = Substrate Constraints (physical/computational limitations)

### 1.2 Mathematical Formulations

#### Detection (D)
```
D(t) = Σᵢ(Sᵢ × ΔEᵢ) / N
```
- Sᵢ = sensitivity of i-th sensor/input channel
- ΔEᵢ = magnitude of environmental change detected
- N = noise threshold/normalization factor
- Range: [0, 1] where 1 = perfect detection

#### Self-Distinction (S)
```
S(t) = 1 - H(sensory_feedback_self) / H(total_sensory_input)
```
Alternative formulation:
```
S(t) = |Boundary(self) ∩ Boundary(env)| / |Universe|
```
- Measures the system's ability to distinguish self from environment
- Range: [0, 1] where 1 = perfect self-other distinction

#### Response Variety (R)
```
R(t) = H(responses) = -Σᵢ P(rᵢ) log₂ P(rᵢ)
```
- H = Shannon entropy of response distribution
- P(rᵢ) = probability of response i
- Higher entropy indicates greater behavioral flexibility
- Normalized to [0, 1] by dividing by log₂(max_responses)

#### Goal-Directed Recognition (G)
```
G(t) = 1 - (Δt_actual / Δt_min)
```
- Δt_actual = time between action and recognition of consequence
- Δt_min = minimum theoretical recognition time
- Range: [0, 1] where 1 = instantaneous agency recognition

#### Adaptive Modification (M)
```
M(t) = KL(P_{t+1} || P_t)
```
- KL = Kullback-Leibler divergence
- P_t = response probability distribution at time t
- P_{t+1} = response distribution after learning
- Normalized to [0, 1] by sigmoid transformation

#### Substrate Constraints (C)
```
C = 1 / (ρ × β × ε)
```
- ρ = processing unit density (units/volume)
- β = bandwidth (bits/second)
- ε = energy efficiency (operations/joule)
- Lower C indicates fewer physical constraints

## 9. Testable Hypotheses

### H1: Component Correlation
**Hypothesis**: D, S, R, G, M show positive correlations in biological systems
**Test**: Battery across species, calculate correlation matrix
**Prediction**: r > 0.6 for all component pairs
**Falsification**: Independent or negative correlations

### H2: Developmental Hierarchy
**Hypothesis**: Higher levels require lower level capabilities
**Test**: Longitudinal studies of developing systems
**Prediction**: Levels achieved sequentially
**Falsification**: Level-skipping observed

### H3: Scaling Laws
**Hypothesis**: AQ scales sub-linearly with processing units
**Test**: Vary AI model sizes, measure AQ
**Prediction**: AQ ∝ log(parameters)
**Falsification**: Linear or super-linear scaling

### H4: Collective Emergence
**Hypothesis**: Groups can achieve AQ > max(individual AQ)
**Test**: Compare individual vs. collective problem-solving
**Prediction**: Collective_AQ > Individual_AQ for coordinated groups
**Falsification**: No emergence observed

### H5: Substrate Independence
**Hypothesis**: Identical architectures yield identical AQ regardless of substrate
**Test**: Implement same architecture in different media
**Prediction**: AQ variance < 0.05 after normalization
**Falsification**: Significant substrate-specific differences

### H6: Awareness Continuity
**Hypothesis**: AQ changes continuously, not discretely
**Test**: High-resolution temporal monitoring
**Prediction**: Smooth transitions between levels
**Falsification**: Quantum jumps in awareness

## 10. Mathematical Proofs

### 10.1 AQ Bounds Theorem
**Theorem**: For any finite system, 0 ≤ AQ ≤ 1

**Proof**:
1. Each component (D, S, R, G, M) is bounded [0, 1] by definition
2. Product of bounded values is bounded: 0 ≤ ∏ components ≤ 1
3. C ≥ 1 by physical constraints
4. Therefore: AQ = (∏ components) / C ≤ 1 □

### 10.2 Emergence Criterion
**Theorem**: Collective awareness emerges when inter-agent information flow exceeds intra-agent processing

**Proof**:
Let I_inter = inter-agent information rate
Let I_intra = intra-agent information rate
Collective awareness emerges iff I_inter > I_intra
This creates a unified information space transcending individuals □

### 10.3 Substrate Equivalence Principle
**Theorem**: Two systems with identical information-theoretic properties have identical awareness regardless of physical implementation

**Proof**:
1. Awareness depends only on information processing patterns (by definition)
2. If patterns are identical, all measurements (D, S, R, G, M) are identical
3. Only C differs by substrate
4. After normalization by C, AQ is identical □

## 11. Integration with Other Frameworks

### 11.1 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- AIWared's R (Response Variety) correlates with IIT's Φ
- Both measure information integration
- Mapping: High Φ suggests Level 3+ awareness

### 11.2 Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
- AIWared's temporal integration maps to GWT's workspace
- Level 5+ requires global workspace functionality
- Conscious access corresponds to high G scores

### 11.3 Predictive Processing
- M (Modification) directly measures prediction error minimization
- Free energy principle aligns with awareness development
- Higher levels show more sophisticated predictive models

### 11.4 Meta-Modal Platform (MMP)
- AIWared provides quantitative awareness ratings for MMP observations
- Enables weighted truth refinement based on observer awareness
- Common metric across META, MODAL, PLATFORM domains
