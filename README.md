\\# AIWared  



\\\*\\\*Defining Universal Awareness Across Biological \\\& Artificial Systems\\\*\\\*  







---







\\## Overview  



AIWared is a cross-disciplinary framework for measuring, validating, and contextualizing awareness in both biological and artificial systems.  



It integrates principles from:  



\\- \\\*\\\*Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\\\*\\\*  



\\- \\\*\\\*Global Workspace Theory (GWT)\\\*\\\*  



\\- \\\*\\\*Information Theory \\\& Complexity Metrics\\\*\\\*  



\\- \\\*\\\*Behavioral Analysis\\\*\\\*  



\\- \\\*\\\*Cross-domain validation protocols\\\*\\\*  







The goal is to establish a \\\*\\\*Single Source of Truth (SSOT)\\\*\\\* for awareness measurement that is scientifically rigorous, ethically grounded, and reproducible.
